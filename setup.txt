How to setup the flask environment

set up virtual environment (if not setup):
	python3 -m venv ..

source virtual environment
	source ../bin/activate

install required packages:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

get installed packages and save them (if packages change)
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

update user db:
	flask db init --multidb (creates db if it does not exist)
	flask db migrate -m "comment" (if changes in model/models.py were made)
	flask db upgrade (if changes in model/models.py were made)

In main directory
	Add .flaskenv
	Add directory DataUpload

In app/stats
	Add Medium.pkl, Publication.pkl

Finally, run app (development mode only)
	flask run



Production:
decide on a production server configuration, e.g. gunicorn
generate secret key:
	python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4().hex)"
replace sqlite with mysql using pymysql

in .flaskenv:
	remove FLASK_DEBUG=1
	set up mail service
	DATA_DB: use read-only account
