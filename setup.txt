How to setup the flask environment

set up virtual environment (if not setup):
	python3 -m venv ..

source virtual environment
	source ../bin/activate

install required packages:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

get installed packages and save them (if packages change)
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

update user db:
	flask db init --multidb (if db does not exist)
	flask db migrate -m "comment" (if changes in model/models.py were made)
	flask db upgrade (if changes in model/models.py were made)


Finally, run app (development mode only)
	flask run

Production:
decide on a production server configuration, e.g. gunicorn
generate secret key:
	python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4().hex)"
replace sqlite with mysql using pymysql
